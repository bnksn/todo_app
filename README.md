# todo_app
This is a simple todo list web app that has been built using the Flask framework. The app is dynamic and uses a relational database to store the tasks. For the database I have used MySQL. This project is a tool to help improve my understanding of such technologies.

## How to use the app
1. Download the files
2. Use pip to install flask and flask_mysqldb
3. Create a mysql database with one column
4. Edit site.py by adding in the database information
5. Run site.py
6. Connect to the app (the default address will be localhost:5000)
